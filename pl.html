        <p>John Milton's Paradise Lost is an epic. Earlier it had ten books (parts) only but later it was re-arranged into twelve books. It was published in 1667.<br><br>

The main source of this epic was the Bible (Genesis), particularly a brief account of the Creation, the Fall of Man and the condemnation to spiritual and physical death.       <br><br>

The poet reveals that this epic is on the subject of man's first disobedience as tasting of the fruit of the forbidden tree, viz. apple. As a result, death Intered the world, and also the sufferings. Adam and Eve lost Eden. The redemption of the sin was brought by one greater man, i.e. Christ. He restored and regained the blissful seat of Paradise.       <br><br>

The poet invokes the heavenly Muse to inspire him to learn how heaven and earth were created out of Chaos. He invokes the Muse from where she is-on Sion hill or by Siloa's brook. The poet wants to sing an adventurous song about the things which have remained unattempted yet. First of all, he invokes the Muse who prefers pure heart. She must instruct him what was present in the beginning and sat dove like on the vast abyss and made it full of life. He wants to be illumined: What is low in him, to raise and support it so that he can assest eternal providence of God. He wants to justify the ways of God to Man.       <br><br>

The poet implores the Muse to illumine him as God keeps her furnished with all knowledge about Heaven and Hell. She must reveal the cause of the disobedience and the fall of Man. Who seduced Man to revolt against God and his Will? It was the informal serpent who was envious and revengeful, he seduced Eve-the mother of mankind. Pride had caused Satan's expulsion from Heaven with all his rebel-followers. By whose help he trusted to challenge the authority of God and put himself to be the leader of the evil angels?       <br><br>

Satan protested against God, against His throne (supremacy) and monarchy. Satan had fostered an ambition. Why did he raise a war against God? His attempt of revolt failed, why?       <br><br>       

God took Satan's futile exercise seriously and thrust him headlong from sky into flames. He was thrown into bottomless perdition. Satan was tied with adamantine (unbreakable) chains and he was compelled to live in penal fire.       <br><br>

Satan defied (challenged) the Omnipotent to take arms, i.e. strict decision against Satan.       <br><br>

Satan and his evil companions lay stunned rolling in the lake of fire for nine days and nights.             <br><br>

Satan says to Beelzebub that they would pursue their revenge against God and there would be immortal hate for Him. They would never lost- surrender. God's vengeance could not win their glory of submission. They would not seek forgiveness. It would be disgrace and shame to bow to Him. They are not inferior to God, rather they are superior to Him in foresight.       <br><br>

They have a greater hope to wage eternal war and would succeed by fair or foul means. They would never think of a reconciliation with God.       <br><br>

Thus Satan addressed. He was heavily tortured. The defeat and expulsion caused him despair but he concealed it using words of boasting.</p>
