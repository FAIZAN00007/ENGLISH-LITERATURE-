        <center><h1>REMEMBRANCE </h1></center>
        <p>When I'm silently reflecting on things that have happened in the past, I feel disappointed that I failed to get the things I wanted. Old sorrows feel new again, and I complain about how I wasted my precious. time. Then I can weep heavily, even though I rarely cry, for dear friends who have died; I can weep again for lost loves I'd once gotten over; I can complain about things that have been destroyed. Then I get angry about old insults, and I complain about one bad thing after another: a sad tale of things I've already complained about, which feel as painful now as they did before. But, if I stop and think about you, dear friend, everything I've lost returns to me and all my sorrows end.<br><br>

In "Sonnet 30," the speaker rehashes all the injuries and disappointments of life: dead friends, lost pleasures, squandered opportunities. For the speaker, neither memory nor time itself diminishes the pain of these losses: just to think about them brings them back in their full power and difficulty. Indeed, the speaker suggests that memory itself is a powerful source of pain.</p>
