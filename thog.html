      <center> <h1>THE GIFTS OF GOD</h1></center>
        <p>When God created man, he wanted to give his new creation all possible blessings, such as beauty, wisdom, honor, and pleasure. God gives these blessings to man by pouring them out of a "glass of blessings." The only blessing that God leaves in the bottle is "Rest." This gift is so precious that God does not want to give it to man; if man would have it, he would worship "Nature, not the God of Nature."
        </p>
        <p>God prefers that man should be "rich and weary," so that eeriness may toss him to God's breast. In other words, if man will at least be tired, he will have reason to fear God. If God bestow this jewel also on creature, He would adore his gifts instead of God, and rest in Nature, not the God of Nature; thus, both are losers. God is concerned that man will rest in Nature, and not in Him.
        </p>
        <p>God had full knowledge that His treasures would tire man and make him exhausted. He wanted man to find true rest only in Him. He wants all of us to come to Him, for He alone can truly give us the rest we so desperately seek. It is in his weariness, then, that man will realize his imperfections and his need for God and the spiritual life. Then, he will reach for God's "pulley" and seek heaven.</p>
