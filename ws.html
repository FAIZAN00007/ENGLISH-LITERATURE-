        <center><h1>A WEDDING SONG</h1></center>
       <p>Edmund Spenser's poem 'A Wedding Song' is taken from his longer work 'Epithalamion' (a Greek word which means a wedding song). It was written probably in 1594. It celebrates the poet's own marriage with Elizabeth Boyle.</p>
       <p>The poet has expressed his personal feelings in a picturesque way. The lady's divine beauty is described naturally.
       </p>
       <p>The bride is coming out of her house. There is a procession going to the church for the betrothal ceremony. She walks with gentle steps, like Phoebe (goddess of Moon) arising out of the eastern horizon.</p>
       <p>The lady is dressed fully in white which suits to a virgin. This appearance makes one feel as if some angel has appeared. Her long, loose and yellow locks look like wires studded with pearls having flowers between them. She has a golden mantle. She is decorated with a green garland and she looks like a maiden queen.</p>
       <p>Her modest eyes blush to see so many gazers who stare at her.
       </p>
       <p>Her looks are fixed on the ground. Her appearance is so bold that she cannot dare lift up her eyes. She blushes to hear her loud praises. The loudness echoes in all the woods.
         </p>
      
      <p>The poet wants that the church-gate be opened widely so that the lady (bride) may enter. All the posts and pillars be decorated suitably. He instructs to welcome her like a saintly figure with due honour. She comes before the crucifix with trembling steps and reverence. The virgins should learn from her obedience for them-when they come to a holy place. The poet wants that she should be brought upto the high altar so that the sacred ceremonies (rites) can be performed. It would make the marriage endless. So the organs should be played loudly. The church chorister should sing a joyous anthem. The music produced during the ceremonies should be very loud and the woods shoul echo (resound) it.
      </p>
      <p>The poet says that the bride is standing before the altar. The holy priest speaks to her and blesses her with two hands. The red roses flush up in her snow-white cheeks. The dyed red colour on her cheeks makes the angels forget their duty of guarding the altar. They look at her face eagerly.
      </p>
      <p>She still has her eyes lowered to the ground. She is modest and does not allow a bad thought. The poet asks her why does she blush while giving her hand to him, making a pledge of bond?
      </p>
      <p>He asks the virgins to bring her home in a procession. He furher asks the angels to sing the hymns which will echo in the woods. Critical notes (i) There is picturesqueness in the lines. (ii) A scene, before the altar, is presented. (iii) The angels are addressed as 'sweet'.
      </p>
      
      <p>There is a description of the banquet after the performing of the betrothal ceremonies. There is a mood of festivity. The virgins are asked to bring the bride as a trophy and the bridegroom with her, as he is the glory of his love. It is made a joyful day by the blessings of Heaven (God).
      </p>
      <p>The poet wants that the arrangement be made for a grand banquet for celebration. Hymen, god of marriage, should also crown himself. The three goddesses should also be present there to dance.
      </p>
      <p>The maids should sing their carol which the woods would echo.</p>
