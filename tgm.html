      <center><h1>THE GOOD MORROW</h1></center>
        <p>What did you and I even do before we were in love? Were we still breastfeeding? Did we only enjoy simple, childish things? Or were we fast asleep with the Seven Sleepers? It's true. But all of this is just pleasure's dream. If I ever wanted and gained something beautiful, it was just a dream of you.<br><br>
     
And now good morning to our souls, which are waking up. They do not watch each other out of fear. There's no need for jealousy; love makes it so that we don't need to look at anything except each other. And it makes one small room as wide as the world. Let explorers cross the ocean to discover new worlds. Let other people make maps, charting worlds upon worlds. Let us have just one world: each of us is a world, and so each of us has a world.<br><br>

My face appears in your eye and your face appears in my eye. And the truth of our hearts is visible in our faces. Where can we find two better globes, without the cold of the north or the darkness that comes when the sun sets in the west? When something dies, it dies because its parts were not appropriately mixed. But our loves are so perfectly matched that we have become one, and thus our love will not lose its power, and we will not die.</p>
