    <center><h1>MY LADY IN LOVE CHARIOT</h1></center>
    <p>The poet draws our attention to the chariot of Love which is nearby him. The lady-love is approaching riding on the same chariot. It is drawn by a swan or a dove. It is under the guidance of Love.<br><br>

When the beautiful lady moves, the beholders do what is due from their side. They worship the unique beauty. They wish good to her out of love because it gives them joy. They wish to accompany her- wherever she might go to the battlefields or for voyages. Her chariot may move to any place but they wish to go with her following her.<br><br>


The poet has expressed that the onlookers were much impresse by the extreme beauty of the lady riding on the chariot. The beauty of her eyes, the brightness of her eyes, brightens everything that comprises Love's world. Her hair are bright like rising Love's star, viz. Venus. Her forehead is smoother than the soft words of praise expressed to her.<br><br>

Her brows are arched and they have such a grace that sheds itself through her face. Her face has extreme beauty. In her body, all the elements (of which she is made: earth, water, air and fire) are in harmony resulting into perfect physical beauty.<br><br>

These lines begin with a question, rather rhetorical question. Suen questions always remain self-answered. It is asked if one has seen a bright lily growing naturally without getting defiled by ungentle hands touch. Has one seen the fall of the snow before falling on the earth? Has one felt the soft wool of a beaver or a swan's under-feathers? Has one smelt the bud of a wild rose or a sweet-smelling wood into the fire? Has someone tasted the honey?<br><br>

All the above raised questions reach the conclusion that the lady is bright like a lily, pure like the snow, soft like wool or down-feathers, sweet smelling like a bud or nard. Her sweetness is compared to that of honey.<br><br>

In the last time, brightness, softness and sweetness of the lady are described beautifully.</p>
